Since magic8ball[0][0][0] starts at 0x7fffffffe000, the string magic8ball[3][4] will be offset by
3*64 + 4*8 from the starting address. 0x7fffffffe000 + 3*64 + 4*8 = 0x7fffffffe0e0. The data at
0x7fffffffe0e0 is 0x57 0x72 0x6f 0x6e 0x67 0x00 0x00 0x00. Converted into ASCII, this array gives
us the string "Wrong". Therefore, the statement printf(“%s”, magic8ball[3][4]); would print the word
'Wrong'.
